        <h2>The Presence of Toxic Chemicals in Soil</h2>

        <p style="height:30vh; width:95vw">
            Soil pollution is caused by the presence of human-made chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil
            environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal 
            of waste. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical 
            substance. Contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with 
            soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized into the air.
